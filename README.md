Decentralised Roulette is an exciting gambling game built on the Ethereum blockchain network. It enables players to experience the thrill of playing roulette using the cryptocurrency Ether as the unit of transaction. With its decentralized architecture, transparent gameplay, and the security provided by the Ethereum blockchain, Decentralised Roulette offers a fair and trustworthy gambling experience.

## Features

- **Ethereum Blockchain:** The game is powered by the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparent and tamper-proof gameplay.
- **Ether Transactions:** Players can place bets and receive payouts in Ether, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum.
- **Web Interface:** The frontend of the game is built using HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface.

- **Web3.js Library:** We utilize the web3.js library to interact with the smart contract using JavaScript, enabling seamless integration with the Ethereum network.
- **Remix IDE:** The Remix IDE is used to deploy and test the smart contract, providing a user-friendly and efficient development environment.
- **Polygen Testnet:** Although the smart contracts are designed to work on any Ethereum network, we have deployed them on the Polygen Testnet for testing purposes.
- **Metamask Integration:** Players can easily access the game using the Metamask Chrome extension, which acts as an injecting provider for interacting with Ethereum-based applications.
